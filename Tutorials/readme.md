# Tutorials
This series of tutorials was designed to walk through the steps of how to:
* pre-process neurophysiological and behavioral recordings (Tutorial1)
* estimate tuning curves by linear average (Tutorial2.1)
* fit Generalized Linear Models and perform model comparison (Tutorial2.2)
* decode variables from spike trains using a Bayesian approach (Tutorial3.1)
* detect cell assemblies using PCA and ICA (Tutorial3.2)
* calculate trial-by-trial correlations between cell pairs (Tutorial3.3)
* use wavelet transfom and coherence to investigate the selectivity of oscillatory activities (Tutorial4.1)

These tutorials went step-by-step through the code of the following functions, each dedicated to one type of analyses.
- Tutorial1: LoaddataNav.m and LoaddataSpk.m
- Tutorial2.1: MapsAnalysis.m
- Tutorial2.2: GLMAnalysis.m
- Tutorial3.1: DecodingAnalysis.m
- Tutorial3.2: PatternAnalysis.m
- Tutorial3.3: CorssCorrAnalysis.m
- Tutorial4.1: TFMapsAnalysis.m
- The last tutorial (Tutorial_handson) is a simple cheatsheet with short examples on how to use the functions detailed in the previous tutorials.

For more details, see the readme and help sections of the corresponding functions in the Code folder.
